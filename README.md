This repository contains the coursework and code for the Generative AI sessions taken as part of Module 3 in the Women Engineers (WE) Program offered by Talentsprint and supported by Google.

## Agenda:

- [x] Solve one of the computational thinking problems using GenAI, by generating clean, readable, elegant code. 
- [x] Learn about the game of Yahtzee using GenAI tools and engineering to to play a game with me.
- [x] Ask the GenAI tool how to approach writing code for a Yahtzee scorer.
- [ ] Instruct the GenAI tool to create a testing strategy for the Yahtzee scorer code. Test it for correctness.
- [ ] Text generation using Markov Chains.
